                <li> Soak moong dal in hot water for 10 minutes (use little amount of hot water to soak the moong dal, drain the dal from hot water and reserve 0.25 cup of water from it, so that you can use it for cooking the cabbage and you don't want to miss the nutrition from the dal by discarding the water). 
</li><li> Chop the cabbage, onion and green chilies finely. 
</li><li> In a pan heat oil add mustard seeds and allow it to splutter. Add urad dal, curry leaves, onion, green chilies and cook until onion becomes soft.","Add turmeric powder and mix well. Cook until the turmeric powder loses its raw smell.
