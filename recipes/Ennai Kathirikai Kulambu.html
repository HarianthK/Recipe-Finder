            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                <li> Wash the eggplants and make four slits on bottom of the eggplants as I shown in the picture. 
</li><li> In a pan heat a tbsp of oil, add eggplants and roast in a medium flame until it becomes soft and the color changes slightly. Remove eggplants from the oil and keep it aside until needed. Be careful when placing eggplants in the oil because the moisture content in the eggplants makes oil to pop and splutter out of the pan. 
</li><li> In the same pan, heat two tbsp of oil, add mustard seeds and allow it to splutter. Add urad dal, fenugreek seeds and saute until the color changes into golden brown. 
</li><li> Add chopped garlic, grated ginger and saute until the nice aroma comes out. 
</li><li> Add curry leaves, chopped onion and cook until the onion becomes soft. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until it becomes soft and mushy. 
</li><li> Add coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, salt and mix well. Cook until the spices lose its raw smell. 
</li><li> Add 1.50 cups of water, tamarind concentrate and mix well. Allow it to boil for five minutes. If you are using raw tamarind, soak in a hot water for ten minutes and extract juice from it and add to the curry. 
</li><li> Add roasted eggplants, cover and cook for five minutes. Grind shredded coconut with cumin seeds to a smooth paste and add it to the curry. Reduce the flame and boil for another 5 minutes and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
